## Silent Print

This is a Frappe App for printing documents silently, that is, without having to interact with browser's print dialog and send the printing order directly to the printer.

This is achieved using the tool Webapp Hardware Bridge: https://github.com/imTigger/webapp-hardware-bridge.

So far, this app covers the following scenarios:
1. Printing from standard Point of Sales (POS)
2. Printing from any document
